## The Code I'm Still Ashamed Of

This article is about the guy that wrote the code that produces the youtube "Rabbit Hole" effect. While he didn't know his code would have long term psychological repercussions, the code he wrote revolutionized how sites can tailor content to the user. It keeps track of things like the subject matter, length of video, etc about the things you watch and keeps presenting similar content. It's wild to think that this guy wrote some code one day, not realizing that he would contribute so heavily to this massive scrolling addiction. I don't agree with the ethics of it, but I also admit that that is completely retrospective. I understand, now, after the fact, that this is problematic, but I can understand how at the time of creation it seems like something that was user-focuses, profitable, and efficient. It's hard because I can see both sides!

## Self Driving Car Ethics

This article was crazy! I've always been interested in self-driving cars and AI in general but never thought about this dilema! It reminds me of the classic Utilitarianism vs. Deontology thought experiment with the train tracks and the lever. I can't say whether I agree with the ethics or not. I beleive that perhaps at the moment it is the best possible optiion to save the people in the car if there are more, until we can find a solution that's safer, but I really don't know. I will definitely be wary of the sorts of jobs I look for in the future after reading about this stuff, I definitely could not handle the pressure of having such big responsiblity in the hands of my code.
