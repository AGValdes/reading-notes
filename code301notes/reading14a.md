# Database Normalization

- Using operators like `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` makes your query more specific, so you don't need subqueries.
- `PIVOT` operator rotates a table-valued expression. It turns the unique values in one column into multiple columns in the output and performs aggregations on any remaining column values.
- built in **SQL String functions** make it possible for you to find and alter text values, such as VARCHAR and CHAR datatypes, in SQLServer
- there are also built in **logic functions**
- you can **string together** tables in SQL
