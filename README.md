## Growth Mindset 
A "growth mindset" is a mindset fostered by those who believe that there is always room to grow when it comes to learning. I personally subscribe to this mindset. I believe that, although it does help to have innate talent, hard work and perserverance will lead to growth and will result in a more enriching and deep understanding of whatever topic you are trying to learn. 

### Staying in the Growth Mindset
-Set Goals. Break down tasks into smaller, easier to digest bits.
-Be kind with yourself. Be patient with yourself when you don't understand something.
-Reach out for support. Asking for help is fundemental to learning and does not mean you are dumb or incompitent, it is how you learn!
