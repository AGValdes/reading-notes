# Styling with CSS

- CSS or **Cascading Style Sheets** is a language used for adding style to your web page i.e. color, positions, sizing etc.
- it is best practice to have a CSS sheet be it's own file, for scalability and organization.
- CSS is read from top to bottom, make sure you don't negate rules from the top with something lower down.
- CSS uses **declarations** made up of 2 parts: the property you want to change and its value. **EX:** property: font-family value: arial

## Chapter 11: Color 

- Color brings your site to life and creates a mood or evokes a reaction from your viewer.
**3 Ways to Specify Color:**
- RBG (Red Blue Green) Values **EX:** rgb(102.205.170) numbers refer to how much red blue and green are in the color
- Hex Codes **EX:** #66cda RGB values are rendered into numbers and letters.
- Color names **EX:** darkcyan There are 147 recognized color names.
- There are color pickers online to help find the hex tag of the color you want.
- Contrast is super important between the background and text so that it is easy for viewers to read.
- In **CSS3** you can manipulate opacity with a new value added to RGB colors, **RGBA**
- You can express colors with **HSL** values in CSS3 with an optional opacity value **HSLA**
- **HSLA:** Hue, Saturation, Lightness, Alpha (opacity)
