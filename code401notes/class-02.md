# Class 02: Unit Tests and Documentation

## Unit Testing Best Practices

Not all tests are unit tests
- unit tests do not deal with their environment or with external systems to the codebase itself.
- meaning,  if it you’ve written something that can fail when run on a machine without the “proper setup,” you haven’t written a unit test.
- Unit tests also don’t count as other sorts of tests.
- unit tests don’t exercise multiple components of your system and how they act.
In C#, you can think of a unit as a method:
- unit tests test methods
- Arrange, Act, Assert
- Avoid test interdependance

## XUNIT Document

## Art of README
The README is meant to:
- tell them what it is (with context)
- show them what it looks like in action
- show them how they use it
- tell them any other relevant details
- be brief
- without a README coders will have to dive into the code to understand it
- a predictable format
- certain key elements present

## README Best Practices

A nifty repository that provides a good framework for READMEs
