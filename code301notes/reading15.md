# Class 15 Reading Notes: Diversity and Inclusion

### Silicon Valley's Gender Gap

This article proposes that computer game marketing in the 80's and 90's is responsible for the gender gap that exists in the tech industry. When personal computers were emerging, they were mostly being used for computer games, so gaming was many people's first experience with computers and computer science. These computer games were heavily marketed towards boys. With technology as we know it being so new, and boys getting the most exposure to it, the number of women pursuing computer science degrees and landing jobs in tech has descreased significantly as compared to the 1980's.

### Employee Breakdowns of Key Tech Companies:
- According to the graph, on average, large tech companies have a gap of atleast 10%, very many having a lot more.

### Why Diversity Matters to your Tech Company:
- Diverse teams are stronger and more creative.
- Diverse companies perform better.
- Companies may lose out on great talent by not hiring a diverse staff.
- Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base.
- It's the right thing to do. (I think this should have been the first reason, but ok.)
