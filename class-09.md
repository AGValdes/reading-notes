# Class 09 Reading Notes

## Chapter 7: Forms
- When you want to collect information on your page, you create a from using a `<form>` element
- Information from a form is sent in **name/value** pairs
- Each form control is given a **name**, and the **values** are the text the user types or the options they select, which are sent to the **server**.
- HTML5 has new form elements which make it easier to fill in forms.

## Chapter 14: "lists, tables, and forms"
- There are several CSS elements that are specifically used to style lists, tables and forms.
- list markers can be given different appearances using the `list-style-type` and `list-style-image` properties.
- Table cells can have different borders and spacing in different browsers.
- There are properties you can use to control this.
- Forms are easier to use if the form controls are **vertically aligned** using CSS
- Forms benefit from styles that make them *feel* more interactive.

## Chapter 6: Events

- **Events:** the browser's way of indicating when something has happened
- **EX:** when a page has finished loading, when a button is clicked
- **Binding:** the process of stating which event you are waiting to happen, and which element you are waiting for that event to happen upon.
- When an event occurs on an element, it can **trigger a JS function** This makes it feel interactive to the user because it responds to their input.
- you can use **event delegation** to monitor for events that happen on all of the children of an element.
- **Most commonly used events:** W3C DOM events
