# Class 10 Reading

## Chapter 10: Error Handling and Debugging:

- **Debugging:** the process of finding errors by using deduction.
- the **console** helps narrow down the area in which the error is located, so you can try to find its exact error.
- JavaScript has **7** different types of errors. 
- Each of these creates its own **error object**, which can tell you what line the error is on and gives a description of the error.
- if you are anticipating an error, use the **try, catch  finally** statements to give your users useful feedback.
