# Class 07: Interfaces

## "I Can..."

- classes can opt in to an interface in order to **gain and share** functionality.
- provides **rules and properties** **required** for a class to do the work described in the interface.
- different instances of interfaces can do different things.
- inheritance works similarly to classes, but a class can use **multiple interfaces** and inherit their properties and methods.
