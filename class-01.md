# Class 01 Reading Notes

## Examples of HTML5 Elements:
- **Headers and Footers:** `<header></header> <footer></footer>`
- **Navigation:** `<nav></nav>`
- **Articles:** `<article></article>`
- **Asides:** `<aside></aside>`
- **Secitons:** `<section></section>`
- **Heading Groups:** `<hgroup></hgroup>`
- **Figures:** `<figure></figure>`
- **Sectioning Elements(Divs):** `<div></div>`

## Chapter 8: Extra Markup
- Doctypes tell the browser which version of HTML you are using. Example: `<!DOCTYPE html>`
- Add comments to code with `<!--...-->`
- To identify elements for styling later use id and class atributes. Example: `<p class="greenbox"></p>`
- `<div>` and `<span>` elements let you group block level and inline elements.
- `<iframes>` cut windows into the webpage that you can see other webpages in. Example: a google maps frame on a page.
- `<meta>` tag supplies info like about the author and other info about your webpage without being visible on the main page.
- Use **escape characters** to make special characters show up and not be confused as code. Example: copyright symbol is `&copy`

## Chapter 17: HTML 5 Layout
- HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of the webpage as well as help describe its structure.
- Older browsers that don't understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level and which are in-line elements. You can make these HTML% elements work in older browsers with extra JavaScript.

## Chapter 18: Process and Design
- Identify and understand your target audience, the information that they want, when and how often they are likely to return to your site.
- Use a **site map** to plan the structure of the site.
- Use a **wireframe** to organize how the information will be layed out the page.
- Designing a webpage is all about communication.
- **Visual Heirarchy** helps visitors prioritize and understand the information you are trying to give them. You can establish this using syling, color, sizing, grouping and similarity.

## Chapter 1: ABC's of Programming

- writing a script is just like writing very detailed instructions for a computer. *I.E. the hoodie exercise from 102*
- identifying each step of a process is important to making it function correctly and it all situations.
- JavaScript files are text files and it is best practice to keep your JS in seperate files with the **.js** extension.
- The `<script>` element in HTML tells a browser to load the script, just like the `<link>` element for CSS.
- Javascript does not change the source html code, because it works off of the "model" of the webpage that the browser has created.

### Objects and Methods
- A computer creates a "model" of the work using data -> models use objects to to represent physical things -> i.e. the hotel example
**Objects can have:**
- properties that tell us about the object 
- methods that do tasks using these properties
- events that are triggered when a user interacts with the interface.

- **Object:** **document**.write('Good Afternoon!');
- **Member Operator:** document **.**write('Good Afternoon!');
- **Method:** document.**write('Good Afternoon!)**;
- **Parameters:** document.write(**'Good Afternoon!'**);
