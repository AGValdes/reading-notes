# Class 04 Reading Notes

## Chapter 4: Links
- links are created using the `<a>` element.
- `<a>` element uses the **href** attribute- this indicates the page you are linking to.
**Relative URLS:** shorthand way to tell the browser where a page is in relation to the current page
- **same folder:** just use file name.
- **child folder:** childfolder/filename
- **grandchild folder:** childfolder/grandchildfolder/filename
- **parent folder:** ../filename
- **grandparent folder:** ../../filename
**Email links**
- `<a href="mailto:joe@example.org">`
**Open link in new window:**
- `<a href="http://www.blah.com" target="_blank> Example code</a>`
Use id's to link to a specific part of the page 
- **EX:** `<a href="#top">`
- to link to a specific part of another page just add to the end of your a elememt as long as the other page has identifying id's as well.

## Chapter 15: Layout

- `<div>` elements are often used as containers to group together secitons of the page.
- browsers will always display pages in normal flow unless you specify **relative**, **absolute**, or **fixed** positioning.
- **float:** moves content to the left or right. require a defined width
- pages can have a **fixed width** or **liquid** layouts.
- **liquid layout:** uses percentages to specify the width of each box so it is responsive to different screen sizes.
- pages are ususally **960-1000px** wide, most important info defining the site should be in the top **600px**.
- **grids** are used to create professional designs that are flexible.
- you can include multiple CSS files in one page.
- **CSS Frameworks** are bits of code that are prefabricated to carry out certain tasks like creating layout grids, styling forms, to make printer-friendly things, etc.

- Declaring a function: **function** (keyword) *function name* ( Parameters ) { code block } 

## Pair Coding

- typically in pair coding one person is the **driver**, or person who types the code and handles mechanics, and one **navigator:** who dictates the ideas outloud, and helps with code checking etc.

- it is efficient
- you are more focused
- you get 2 different perspectives working toward 1 goal
- it improves social skills
