# Writing a Script
- writing a script is just like writing very detailed instructions for a computer. I.E. the hoodie exercise
- identifying each step of a process is important to making it function correctly and it all situations.

## Expressions:
Expressions evaluate or result in a single value
- assign a value to a variable : `var color = 'beige';`
- use two or more values to return a single value `var are = 3 * 2;`

## Operators:
Expressions rely on operators. Operators allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values
- **Assignment**
- **Arithmatic**
- **String**
- **Cpmparison**
- **Logical**

## Functions:
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function. Functions can also store the steps needed to perform a task.
- **Calling a function:** asking a function to perform a task. Call a function with its *function name*
- **Parameters:** pieces of information passed to a function
- **Return Value:** the answer you expect a function to respond with.
- Declaring a function: **function** (keyword) *function name* ( Parameters ) { code block }
