# What makes a Computer a Computer
There are 4 things that classify a "computer":
## Input
Information is input into modern computers using **hardware** i.e. keyboards, cameras etc. 

## Storage
Input information is them stored in the computer's **RAM** or random access memory for processing

## Processing
Information stored in **RAM** is accessed by the **CPU** or central processing unit. Stored input information is then translated into binary code to be processed by the CPU's **circuits**
- **Operating Systems:** Software stored in a computer that instructs the computer how to process information between software and hardware and download software into memory. 

## Output
The processed information is output to a hardware device and back to the user. 

# But Like, How Though?
Input info is tranlated to binary, which results in the firing of electrcity in wires in complex circuit boards in the CPU, happening at billions of fires a second. The invention of smaller and faster CPU circuit boards allows modern computers to not only just calculate numbers like models of the past, but to do increasingly complex calculations and functions. 

# Quick Binary Run-Down
All values, letters, colors, sounds can be rendered into decimal numbers, which can be rendered into binary. 
**EX:** "A"= 1 , RBG (220.28.423), sound wave forms
- Instead of decimal system: 1s, 10s, 100s, 1000s etc.
- Binary: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s
**EX:** 0009 = 1001
