# Chapter 17: HTML 5 Layout
- HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of the webpage as well as help describe its structure.
- Older browsers that don't understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level and which are in-line elements. You can make these HTML% elements work in older browsers with extra JavaScript.
## Examples of HTML5 Elements:
- **Headers and Footers:** `<header></header> <footer></footer>`
