# Chapter 18: Process and Design
- Identify and understand your target audience, the information that they want, when and how often they are likely to return to your site.
- Use a **site map** to plan the structure of the site.
- Use a **wireframe** to organize how the information will be layed out the page.
- Designing a webpage is all about communication.
- **Visual Heirarchy** helps visitors prioritize and understand the information you are trying to give them. You can establish this using syling, color, sizing, grouping and similarity.

# Chapter 17: HTML 5 Layout
- HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of the webpage as well as help describe its structure.
- Older browsers that don't understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level and which are in-line elements. You can make these HTML% elements work in older browsers with extra JavaScript.
## Examples of HTML5 Elements:
- **Headers and Footers:** `<header></header> <footer></footer>`
- **Navigation:** `<nav></nav>`
- **Articles:** `<article></article>`
- **Asides:** `<aside></aside>`
- **Secitons:** `<section></section>`
- **Heading Groups:** `<hgroup></hgroup>`
- **Figures:** `<figure></figure>`
- **Sectioning Elements(Divs):** `<div></div>`

# Chapter 8: Extra Markup
- Doctypes tell the browser which version of HTML you are using. Example: `<!DOCTYPE html>`
- Add comments to code with `<!--...-->`
- To identify elements for styling later use id and class atributes. Example: `<p class="greenbox"></p>`
- `<div>` and `<span>` elements let you group block level and inline elements.
- `<iframes>` cut windows into the webpage that you can see other webpages in. Example: a google maps frame on a page.
- `<meta>` tag supplies info like about the author and other info about your webpage without being visible on the main page.
- Use **escape characters** to make special characters show up and not be confused as code. Example: copyright symbol is `&copy`
