# Class 06: OOP

## OOP
Object Oriented programming:
- everything is an object
- make things (objects with properties)
- make things work(object methods)
- make things that **work together**(inheritence)

## Inheritance: 
- object aquires all the properties of a parent object
- can only inherit from 1 class, but supports a hierarchy, meaning all classes the class you are ihneritting from inherits from will also give that class properties.
- children derive properties and methods from parents.

## Abstraction:
- Base class is a template for an object, cannot make a direct instance of an abstract class. 
- Abstract classes establish "rules" or "instructions" for derived classes
- Abstract methods and properties MUST be instantiated with a new instance.

## Encapsulation:
- Public: all classes have access
- Private: only this class has access
- Protected: only this class and its children have access.
