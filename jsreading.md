# Chapter 1c: How Do I Write Script for a Webpage
-JavaScript files are text files and it is best practice to keep your JS in seperate files with the **.js** extension.
- The `<script>` element in HTML tells a browser to load the script, just like the `<link>` element for CSS.

# Chapter 2: Basic JavaScript Instructions
- **Statement:** Each individual step or instruction for the browser to follow. **EX:** `document.wrtie(greeting);`
- **Comment** in your code using `/*...*\` for **multi-line comments** and `//...` for **single-line comments**
-**Variable:** a way to store bits of data.
Declare values with **var** and assign them values with **=**. 
## Three Data Types:
- **Numeric**
- **String**
- **Boolean**
- You can change the value of variable later in the script.
