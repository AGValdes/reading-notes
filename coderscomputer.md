# Choosing A Text Editor
### What Is A Text Editor
A text editor can be a software that you download or use through the web that does exactly what it sounds like: edits text. There are many different text editors out there, both open-source and pay-to-use, each with its own set of props and cons.Inside a text editor, you can write and manange the code for your website. 
### Good Things to Look For In A Text Editor
- **Code Completion:** Some text editors will auto-suggest things like closing brackets and commands to make coding faster.
- **Syntax Highlighting:** This colors the text of different bits of syntax so you can differentiate different elements easier. For example attributes having a different color than elements.
- **Themes:** These are just different styles of background colors vs. text colors that you can customize to make your coding less fatiguing on the eyes.
- **Extensions:** These are like plug-ins for your text editor. There are various different kinds that have different functions that you may need while coding a project.
### Built-in Software Vs. Third Party Softwares
The plain text editor that comes built in to your computer is not always ideal for coding because it doesn't have any of the features listed above. It makes it more difficult to code because you have to be extra vigilant in completeing syntax and finding your own errors. There are many third party softwares available that feature a a combination of all of these features, and there isn't neccisarily a "best" one. You just have to find one that works best and most efficiently for you through trial and error.

# Using the Terminal
The terminal allows you to navigate your computer without using the GUI or Graphic User Interface. The user inputs text commands and recieves text outputs from the system. Here are some [shortcuts](terminalshortcuts.md) and a [command cheat sheet](terminalcommandcs.md) you can use to navigate the terminal. 
-  Some outputs don't display any text unless there is an error.
- Everything is a **file**! Including your keyboard (it's just a file only your system can read!)
- A **path** is a means to get to a certain file or directory. 
- Using the Terminal is **case sensitive**!
- Commands and arguements are seperated by spaces, you must use an escape character when there are spaces in a file or directory name. 
- The first command arguement in a line is called an **option** which modifies the behavior of the command, they typically start with a dash (-).
